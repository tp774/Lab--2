<h1>SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.</h1>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers; <br>
Make haste: who has the note of them?</p>

<p class="character">First Lady</p>
<p>I, madam.</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>Dispatch.</p>
<p>Exeunt Ladies</p>

<p class="character">Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?</p>

<p class="character">CORNELIUS</p>
<p>Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam: <br>
Presenting a small box</p>

<p class="character">But I beseech your grace, without offence,-- <br>
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have <br>
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds, <br>
Which are the movers of a languishing death; <br>
But though slow, deadly?</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>I wonder, doctor, <br>
Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been <br>
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how <br>
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so <br>
That our great king himself doth woo me oft <br>
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,-- <br>
Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet <br>
That I did amplify my judgment in <br>
Other conclusions? I will try the forces <br>
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as <br>
We count not worth the hanging, but none human, <br>
To try the vigour of them and apply <br>
Allayments to their act, and by them gather <br>
Their several virtues and effects.</p>

<p class="character">CORNELIUS</p>
<p>Your highness <br>
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart: <br>
Besides, the seeing these effects will be <br>
Both noisome and infectious.</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>O, content thee.</p>
<p>Enter PISANIO</p>

<p class="character">Aside</p>
<p>Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him <br>
Will I first work: he's for his master, <br>
An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio! <br>
Doctor, your service for this time is ended; <br>
Take your own way.</p>

<p class="character">CORNELIUS</p>
<p>[Aside] I do suspect you, madam; <br>
But you shall do no harm.</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>[To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.</p>

<p class="character">CORNELIUS</p>
<p>[Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has <br>
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit, <br>
And will not trust one of her malice with <br>
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has <br>
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile; <br>
Which first, perchance, she'll prove on <br>
cats and dogs, <br>
Then afterward up higher: but there is <br>
No danger in what show of death it makes, <br>
More than the locking-up the spirits a time, <br>
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd <br>
With a most false effect; and I the truer, <br>
So to be false with her.</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>No further service, doctor, <br>
Until I send for thee.</p>

<p class="character">CORNELIUS</p>
<p>I humbly take my leave.</p>
<p>Exit</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time <br>
She will not quench and let instructions enter <br>
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work: <br>
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son, <br>
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then <br>
As great as is thy master, greater, for <br>
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name <br>
Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor <br>
Continue where he is: to shift his being <br>
Is to exchange one misery with another, <br>
And every day that comes comes to decay <br>
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect, <br>
To be depender on a thing that leans, <br>
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends, <br>
So much as but to prop him?</p>

<p class="character">The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>Thou takest up <br>
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour: <br>
It is a thing I made, which hath the king <br>
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know <br>
What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it; <br>
It is an earnest of a further good <br>
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how <br>
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself. <br>
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think <br>
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son, <br>
Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king <br>
To any shape of thy preferment such <br>
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly, <br>
That set thee on to this desert, am bound <br>
To load thy merit richly. Call my women: <br>
Think on my words.</p>
<p>Exit PISANIO</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>A sly and constant knave, <br>
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master <br>
And the remembrancer of her to hold <br>
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that <br>
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her <br>
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after, <br>
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured <br>
To taste of too.</p>

<p class="character">Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies</p>

<p class="character">QUEEN</p>
<p>So, so: well done, well done: <br>
The violets, cowslips, and the primroses, <br>
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio; <br>
Think on my words.</p>
<p>Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies</p>

<p class="character">PISANIO</p>
<p>And shall do: <br>
But when to my good lord I prove untrue, <br>
I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.</p>
